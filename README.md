```

2. Navigate to the directory:

```

3. Set PowerShell execution policy:

# Option 2: Set for entire system (requires admin)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
```

> Note: Administrator privileges will be requested automatically if needed

## ‚ö° Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Brave Browser
- PowerShell Execution Policy set to at least RemoteSigned
- Administrator privileges (requested automatically)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- PowerShell execution policy must be set to RemoteSigned or less restrictive
- Script automatically requests administrator privileges when needed
- Use `--dry-run` to preview changes without applying them
- `--revert` restores Brave's default settings
- `--default` completely removes all policy settings
- Some changes require a browser restart to take effect

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Execution Policy Error
If you see an execution policy error, try one of these solutions:

1. Set policy for current user only:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

2. Run PowerShell as Administrator and set system-wide policy:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
```

3. Bypass policy for a single execution:
```powershell
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\BetterBrave.ps1
```
